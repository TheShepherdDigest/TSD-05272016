## Seniors' Walk

*From the [Shepherd Middle School Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/sms.shepherdmi/):*

Earlier today, all Shepherd students from the main campus and Winn created a "tunnel" through which graduating seniors walked. It was so great to hear SMS students throughout the day saying things like, "That will be us in four (or five, or six) years!" Thank you to the people who organized this event!!
